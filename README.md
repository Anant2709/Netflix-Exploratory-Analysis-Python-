# Netflix-Exploratory-Analysis-Python
**Netflix**! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into one of the largest entertainment and media companies.

Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, I was intrigued and had questions of my own. 

The questions I wish to answer are:
1. What was the trend durations of films in the 1990s
2. Since I am an action movie fanatic, I know now that most of the action movies made are long and have well developed plots with long action sequences. I wish to see if this hypothesis of mine is right currently and if it is, then has it always been the case. 

The dataset I am working with is `netflix_data.csv`, along with the following table detailing the column names and descriptions. Feel free to experiment further after submitting!
